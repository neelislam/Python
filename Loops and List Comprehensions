Not every game in the Python Challenge Casino is rigged against the player!\n\nIn order to get this answer, you'll need to implement the `estimate_average_slot_payout(n_runs)` function to simulate pulling the slot machine `n_runs` times.  It should return the payout averaged over those `n_runs`.\n\nThen, once the function is defined, in order to estimate the average slot payout, we need only call the function.\n\nBecause of the high variance of the outcome (there are some very rare high payout results that significantly affect the average) you might need to run your function with a very high value of `n_runs` to get a stable answer close to the true expectation.  For instance, you might use a value for `n_runs` of 1000000.\n\nHere's an example for how the function could look:\n```python\ndef estimate_average_slot_payout(n_runs):\n    # Play slot machine n_runs times, calculate payout of each\n    payouts = [play_slot_machine()-1 for i in range(n_runs)]\n    # Calculate the average value\n    avg_payout = sum(payouts) / n_runs\n    return avg_payout\n    \nestimate_average_slot_payout(10000000)\n\n```\n\nThis should return an answer close to 0.025!\n            \n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":20},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"When you think you know the expected value per spin, run the code cell below to view the solution and get credit for answering the question.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Check your answer (Run this code cell to receive credit!)\nq4.solution()","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-07-22T06:25:11.240005Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-07-22T06:25:11.240310Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-07-22T06:25:11.249341Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-07-22T06:25:11.240288Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-07-22T06:25:11.247750Z"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Javascript object>","application/javascript":"parent.postMessage({\"jupyterEvent\": \"custom.exercise_interaction\", \"data\": {\"interactionType\": 3, \"questionType\": 4, \"questionId\": \"4_ExpectedSlotsPayout\", \"learnToolsVersion\": \"0.3.5\", \"valueTowardsCompletion\": 0.0, \"failureMessage\": \"\", \"exceptionClass\": \"\", \"trace\": \"\", \"outcomeType\": 4}}, \"*\")"},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Solution: \n    \nThe exact expected value of one pull of the slot machine is 0.025 - i.e. a little more than 2 cents.
